# 🧭 The Sustainable Sofftware Engineering Manifesto  
## In the Age of Agentic AI
> **AI Automation must amplify engineering judgment — not replace it.**
---

## Why This Manifesto?

Agentic AI systems can now:

- Read repositories  
- Modify files  
- Execute commands  
- Generate large portions of production code  

Their productivity impact is undeniable.

But if adopted without proper governance, they risk eroding:

- Human accountability  
- Design competence  
- Deep validation practices  
- The formative learning pipeline of future engineers  

Software engineering is not mere code fabrication.  
It is the disciplined practice of **design under constraints**.

This manifesto defines the values required to ensure that automation strengthens — rather than weakens — the sustainability of our profession (as software engineers).

# 📜 Our Hierarchy of Values
Inspired by the agile manifesto, we recognize the value of the items on the right.  
But we value the items on the left more.

| We Value | Over |
|-----------|------|
| **Human agency and accountability** | Opaque efficiency without traceability |
| **Explicit design decisions** | Functionally correct auto-generated implementation |
| **Critical evaluation and deep validation** | Practical plausibility |
| **Evidence-based rigorous validation** | Delivery speed |
| **Learning through cognitive friction** | Delegation convenience |
| **Team social capital (mentoring & collaboration)** | Brute-force computational power |
| **Structural prudence (Zero Trust)** | Tool/agent autonomy |

---

# 🛠 What This Means in Practice

Endorsing this manifesto implies concrete commitments:

- AI-generated code remains subject to accountable human review.
- Design intent and trade-offs must be explicit before automation is delegated.
- Early-career engineers must develop design and validation competence.
- Organizations must preserve formative learning pathways.
- Critical systems require transparent validation criteria.
- Automation must elevate engineering judgment — not displace it.

---

# ⚖ Our Position

We are **not anti-AI**.

We are opposed to:

- Ungoverned automation  
- Opaque development pipelines  
- The erosion of engineering judgment in favor of productivity gains through IA 

AI and software engineering discipline are complementary and synergic.

But without deliberate governance, short-term efficiency can undermine long-term resilience.

The sustainability of software engineering requires:

- Human-in-the-loop design  
- Explicit accountability  
- Deep validation  
- Intergenerational knowledge transfer  

Software must remain intelligible, debuggable, and accountable.

# 🌍 Long-Term Vision

We aim to:

- Promote responsible adoption of agentic AI  
- Protect the sustainability of the engineering ecosystem  
- Preserve the cognitive formation of future engineers  
- Encourage accountable AI governance in software development  

Engineering must remain a discipline of judgment.

Not a spectator sport in the age of automation.
